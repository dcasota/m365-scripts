# How to build a tenant from the scratch

Microsoft 365 has become the cornerstone of office collaboration for most companies in nowadays.

For Microsoft 365 engineers it's quite important, to have a lab where to test processed hardening guides, automation and compliance stuff.

So, where to start with?

Here a list of possibilities:
- start with a Microsoft Sharepoint site: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/sharepoint/compare-sharepoint-plans
- start with a Microsoft 365 business plan: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/business/compare-all-microsoft-365-business-products
- start with a Microsoft 365 enterprise business plan: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/enterprise/office365-plans-and-pricing
- start by joining the Microsoft 365 Developer Program: https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365
- check the availability of a domain name: https://o365.rocks/

Setting up a sharepoint site has the advantage of low upfront costs. Usually you get a one month free trial for various licenses as well.

Starting a Microsoft 365 business plan is the path for production.
Most users still work with the desktop versions of Microsoft Office products. The goal of Microsoft 365 Business standard is interoperability and compatibility. The disadvantage of those workflows in general is risk such as dataloss, malware, ransomware, identity theft, rogue devices, network penetration, etc.

A good overview with all different plans and add-ons is available on this [weblink](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=2139145&clcid=0x409&culture=en-us&country=us).

For developer purposes, I started with a Microsoft Sharepoint site and joined then the Microsoft 365 Developer Program.
